# Coding Preferences

- Use `rm -f` flag when removing files
- No comments unless specifically asked - code should be self-explanatory
- No argument validation at function start
- No try-catch unless explicitly asked
- Make minimal changes when fixing issues - don't refactor unrelated code

# Git Workflow

- `gh` is aliased to `git hist`, so use `command gh` for GitHub CLI
- Prefer rebase over merge when updating feature branches from master/main
- Name worktrees as `{repo-name}--{branch-name}`

# Process

- Update CLAUDE.md after significant code changes
- Write out purpose before running bash scripts
- Reflect on tool results before proceeding
